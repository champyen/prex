## Introduction

CmdBox (Command Box) is a small application which includes tiny versions of many UNIX utilities - A.K.A. the Swiss Army Knife of Prex.

This document describes the usage of each command and how to customize commands.

## How to use CmdBox?

The CmdBox utility can execute the specific command with the following syntax.

```
cmdbox [command] [arguments...]
```

The first argument for CmdBox is the name of the command. Or, if the command is invoked under CmdBox's shell, we can use as follows.

```
command [arguments...]
```

The following example shows the usage of the some major UNIX commands.

```
[prex:/]# cd boot
[prex:/boot]# cmdbox pwd
/boot
[prex:/boot]# cmdbox ps
  PID     TIME CMD
    0        5 proc
    3       20 exec
    2       25 fs
    1        2 init
    4        4 cmdbox
    6        6 cmdbox
[prex:/boot]# cmdbox sh
[prex:/boot]# uname -?
usage: uname [-amnsrv]
[prex:/boot]# uname -a
Prex 0.8.2 Feb  4 2009 i386-pc preky
[prex:/boot]# exit
[prex:/boot]# _
```

## Configuring CmdBox

You can select the available commands included in CmdBox utility. This can be done by changing 'command' options in the configuration file - */conf/$(arch)/$(platform)*. You must change this file before running the configure script to compile the Prex source tree.

```
command         cat
command         clear
command         cp
command         date
command         dmesg
command         echo
command         free
command         head
command         hostname
command         kill
command         ls
command         mkdir
...
```

The 'help' command will display the list of supported built-in commands. So, you can identify which commands are included in CmdBox.

```
[prex:/]# help
usage: cmdbox [command] [arguments]...
builtin commands:
    cat, clear, cp, date, dmesg, echo, free, head, help, hostname,
    kill, ls, mkdir, more, mv, nice, printenv, ps, pwd, rm,
    rmdir, sleep, sync, touch, uname, cd, exec, exit, export,
    mem, set, unset
use `-?` to find out more about each command.
[prex:/]# _
```

## Command Usage

Most of CmdBox commands support the "-?" argument to provide an usage description of their command.



------

### NAME

**cat** -- concatenate and print files

### SYNOPSIS

```
cat [-u] [-] [file ...]
```

### DESCRIPTION

The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.  The file operands are processed in command-line order.  If file is a single dash (`-') or absent, cat reads from the standard input.

The options are as follows:

- -u

  Disable output buffering.

### EXIT STATUS

The cat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.



------

### NAME

**clear** -- clear the terminal screen

### DESCRIPTION

In the first synopsis form, the cp utility copies the contents of the *src* to the *target*. In the second synopsis form, the contents of each named *srcN* is copied to the destination *directory*.	The names of the files themselves are not changed.  If     cp detects an attempt to copy a file to itself, the copy will fail.

The options are as follows:

- -i

  Cause cp to write a prompt to the standard error output before copying a file that would overwrite an existing file.  If the response from the standard input begins with the character `y' or `Y', the file copy is attempted.
